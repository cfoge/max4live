To use, in the device click, show devices, then open the console, next to the name of each serial connection on your computer there will be a letter from a-z, select the letter corresponding to the rs232 adapter you are using to talk to the PTZ camera, select baud rate, then click connect button. Check the console window that popped up earlier to see if there was an error connecting.
* you will need a PTZ camera that uses the VISCA protocol as well as a USB to RS232 adapter (assuming your camera is controlled by visca via rs232)
